# Computer-Networks-MiniProject---TCP-Segment-Communication-Simulation
The repository contains the necessary codes for TCP-Segment-Communication-Simulation

# Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a simplified Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Segment Communication Simulation. TCP is a widely used transport layer protocol responsible for reliable data transmission over a network. In this simulation, we will focus on the allocation of the segment numbers based on the number of bytes transmitted and acknowledgment numbers.

# Requirements

C compiler ( e.g GCC)
Operating System with Socket Support (Linux)

## Getting started

## Clone the repository
git clone <project repository link>

## Navigate to the project directory
cd tcp-segment-communication-simulation

## Alternatively
Download The Files Locally And Follow As Given Below

## Compile the client and server programs
gcc TCP-server.c -o server <br />
gcc TCP-client.c -o client

## Run the server
./server 1234

## Run the client
./client 1234
